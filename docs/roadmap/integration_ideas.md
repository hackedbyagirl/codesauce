# Future Integration Ideas

## Function Integration Ideas
- Directory Review
- Project Review
- Code Review
- Directory Rename and Restructure
- Code Cleaning
- File Writing and Saving
- Program/Code Testing
- Error Review

## Automatic Actions
**Directory Review**:
Instructing AI to understand the directory structure by being provided a directory structure layout

**Project Review**:
The user will provide AI with a general description of the project they are reviewing to help the AI system better understand what they are reviewing and to give them context

## AI Functions
**Perform Code Review**: 
This function would analyze the loaded code from each file. It could use techniques like static code analysis or linting to identify potential issues, such as unused variables, code smells, or style violations.

This function would take the analyzed code or specific filename as input and perform the necessary code cleaning operations based on the user's requirements. It could remove unused imports, format the code according to a specific style guide, or apply other code optimizations.

**Code Writer**:
This function would take a specific filename and coding taski/goal as input and be used to generate code 


**Directory Rename and Restructure**:
AI will review the directory structure and potentially the project description and based on best practices and goals of the project, will rename and restructure files to be more efficient and follow best practices



**File Writing and Saving**:
This function would save the cleaned code to new files, preserving the directory structure and filenames. It would create new files with the cleaned code, ensuring that the original files remain unchanged.

**Program/Code Testing**:
AI will generate the required commands to run the program at hand, and then will execute the code to test and see if the program works.

**Error Review**:
This function will allow AI to review errors the program spits out and then provide instructions to address/fix the error at hand
